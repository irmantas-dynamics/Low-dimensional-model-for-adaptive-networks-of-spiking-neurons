# Low-dimensional-model-for-adaptive-networks-of-spiking-neurons

Replication of results from paper ["Low-dimensional model for adaptive networks of spiking neurons" by  B. Pietras, P. Clusella and E. Montbri√≥](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevE.111.014422)

## Code usage

Script `Montbrio_2025_RK4.m` compare results from integration of the network of theta [QIF] neurons vs solutions of macroscopic equations for spiking rate, mean potential and adaptation variable. Integration is performed with Runge-Kutta algorithm.
